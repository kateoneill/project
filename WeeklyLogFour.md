#### Methodology
##### Agile
**What is it?**
A software development methodology that works on the principle of delivering work in small increments. It takes an iterative approach to development that relies on constant evaluation of the teams progress. A massive factor in agile development is having an ability to respond to any changes that may occur in the process. 
<br><br>
Agile is based around four main values as outlined in the manifesto:
- Individuals and action over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plane. 
<br><br>
**Key concepts**
Agile itself is made up a ton of methodologies and frameworks. There's an abundance of key concepts to understand in relation to it. <br>
**Frameworks**
-   **Scrum**
-   **Kanban**
-   Lean
-   Crystal
-   **Extreme Programming (XP)**
-   Feature-Driven Development (FDD)
-   Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
-   **Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)**
-   ScrumBan
-   Agile-Waterfall/Hybrid Agile
-   Scrum XP Hybrid
<br><br>
*SCRUM*<br>
One of the more widely-adopted Agile frameworks. The unit within a scrum is known as a **scrum team** and this involves the scrum master, **product owner** and developers. The scrum master is the scrum expert in the team and oversees how scrum is being used in the team, the product owner is accountable for making sure the team is progressing through the **product backlog** (an agile to-do list). 
<br><br>
Within Scrum the team undertake sprints, which are short bursts of time (4 weeks or less) where the team take items from the product backlog to complete by the end of it. Usually producing a Sprint backlog. There are daily sprints which are meetings among team members to make sure everyone is on track, answer and questions and see that everyone knows what they're doing. The sprint produces a product increment which is ["a version of the product that includes the features and backlog items prioritized and completed during the sprint"](https://www.wrike.com/scrum-guide/scrum-sprints/).  Once one sprint ends it's straight into the next one.
<br><br>
*KANBAN*<br>
The four principles of kanban are:
- Start with what you do now
- Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change
- Respect the current process, roles, responsibilities and titles
- Encourage acts of leadership at all levels in your organisation

Kanban was designed to streamline existing systems. It's not as disruptive as scrum as it's just making existing systems flow better. It's a gentle process improvement as oppose to a complete overhaul. <br><br>
Kanban has 6 main practices: Visualise, Limit Work in Progress(WIP), Manage flow, make policies explicit, implement feedback loops and improve collaboratively. Visualisation involves using Kanban boards with columns such as "To-do, in progress and done". Team members can move items along the flow system as they start them and complete them.  Limiting WIP is a huge part of Kanban so as not to lead to multitasking which in turn results in inefficiency. Managing flow is all about the movement of the work items through the production process being as efficient as possible. Explicit policies means having a clearly defined policy that is available for everyone in a company to see or anyone coming into a company to refer to. Feedback loops are necessary in all kinds of agile, this ensure the company can handle change when it arises, kanban can call them cadences and they encourage a daily team cadence meeting to track flow of work. 
<br><br>
*Extreme Programming*<br>
The five values are:
- Communication
- Simplicity
- Feedback
- Courage 
- Respect
<br>
Communication among developers and with clients is key and they continuously test from day one to get feedback and feed it back into the process. Design is kept simple and they implement changed when asked. Respect is gained throughout the process when everyone is seen contributing. Extreme Programming focuses a lot more attention on technical aspects of software development and making sure that any more technical practice is done to a very high standard.<br><br>
There are 5 phases of extreme programming development. Planning, designing, testing and listening. This covers the inital meeting with client wehre requirements are brought forward, user stories are created (planning) to implementing the XP practices and developing these requirements based on the design(designing + coding). Testing is a huge part of XP - it involves both unit and acceptance tests and then getting feedback from project managers and clients (Listening). Some commonly associated roles are customers who are heavily involved in development and make all business decisions, programmers and developers who execute plans and test, trackers or managers who organise meeting, regulate discussion and keep track of progress and coaches who help with the teams understanding of XP practices.

<br><br>
*Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)*<br>
The eight principles of DSDM:
- Focus on business 
	- Having a good understanding of your business needs and goals so that you can easily identify requirements and features and sort them into one of 4 categories (Must have, should have, could have,  won't have)
- Deliver on time
	- to built trust with the client, things need to be delivered in promised timeframes. Timeboxing techniques should be implemented to get things done on time and in schedule.
- Collaborate
	- the team should work cooperatively and be a cohesive unit. All team members should be able to trust one another and have the same common goal.
- Never compromise quality
	- All team members should be in agreement on quality levels and standards to be upholded.
- Build incrementally from firm foundations
	- Deliver early and improve as the project goes on, similar to Scrum.
- Develop iteratively
	- Features should be constantly tested and feedback should be constantly implemented.
- Communicate continuously and clearly
	- Managing expectations of stakeholders by doing frequent meetings. Daily meetings and good documentation being upheld.
- Demonstrate control
	- tracking progress is a huge part of software development.

<br><br>
Some roles in DSDM are the executive sponsor which are provided by client and allot resources and make decisions. The Visionary identifies the project items of highest priority and makes sure the team tackles them first. The ambassador user who is the user POV and provides feedback. The advisor user who brings interesting/different viewpoints to the project.  The project manager, the technical coordinator  who designs architecture and monitors quality control, the team leader, solution developer who models and develops the deliverables. The solution tester who tests the products and provides feedback when something doesn't work as expected, the scribe who records decisions and requirements for the project, the facilitator who motivates the team members and preparing the workshop. <br><br>


**Advantages and Disadvantages**<br>
*Advantages*<br>
- **Quality** of projects are going to be improved as there is constant testing on softwares and collaboration between developers to get jobs done
- Projects are usually delivered in a **timely manner**
- Less time is caught up in writing up documentation and more time is spent developing, improving and testing projects.
- **Quality Assurance feedback** ensures that developers are constantly up to scratch and producing the highest quality assets.
- There is better **adaption to change** when required because of constant self and team evaluation
- Easy to **collaborate** with customers and colleagues. They have a level of trust with the client as they demonstrate any progress made or obstacles they've faced.
- There is **constant improvement**
- Easy to adapt to any changes in scope of the project during the development process
- As you're producing constant versions of the product and as result of constant feedback you find issues earlier and fix them as you're going along and not only finding out about them at the end of the development process.

*Disadvantages*
- When switching your management style to agile there may be some **difficulty implementing the new system** immediately. Team members need time to acclimatise to using agile. Team leaders may find it difficult finding out where they fit in as agile is a lot more collaborative than other methodologies. 
- There's not as much emphasis in agile on producing **documentation**. As a result of this collating some documentation at the end of the project may take longer than it would have normally done if there was more periodic reviews specifically for documentation.
- This lack of documentation can also mean new team member struggle getting up to speed and understanding how this company works or how they are implementing agile
- It's harder to monitor progress because of the cyclical nature of agile.
- Feature creep can become a massive issue in agile as teams get sidetracked into introducing new functionality.
- Not all features are gonna fit in the cycle length so often they'll get neglected because they don't fit neatly into the system.
- Developers are stuck to one project even if they've completed a certain task for the current project at hand they just have to wait for the next cycle as they'll be needed in that
- Can be difficult to maintain team motivation if they're not seeing any progress.
