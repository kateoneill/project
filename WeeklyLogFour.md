#### Methodology
##### Agile
**What is it?**
A software development methodology that works on the principle of delivering work in small increments. It takes an iterative approach to development that relies on constant evaluation of the teams progress. A massive factor in agile development is having an ability to respond to any changes that may occur in the process.

**Key concepts**

**Pros and Cons**
*PROS*
- **Quality** of projects are going to be improved as there is constant testing on softwares and collaboration between developers to get jobs done
- Projects are usually delivered in a **timely manner**
- Less time is caught up in writing up documentation and more time is spent developing, improving and testing projects.
- **Quality Assurance feedback** ensures that developers are constantly up to scratch and producing the highest quality assets.
- There is better **adaption to change** when required because of constant self and team evaluation
- Easy to **collaborate** with customers and colleagues. They have a level of trust with the client as they demonstrate any progress made or obstacles they've faced.
- There is **constant improvement**

*CONS*
- When switching your management style to agile there may be some **difficulty implementing the new system** immediately. Team members need time to acclimatise to using agile. Team leaders may find it difficult finding out where they fit in as agile is a lot more collaborative than other methodologies. 
- There's not as much emphasis in agile on producing **documentation**. As a result of this collating some documentation at the end of the project may take longer than it would have normally done if there was more periodic reviews specifically for documentation.
- This lack of documentation can also mean new team member struggle getting up to speed and understanding how this company works or how they are implementing agile
- It's harder to monitor progress because of the cyclical nature of agile.
- Feature creep can become a massive issue in agile as teams get sidetracked into introducing new functionality.
- Not all features are gonna fit in the cycle length so often they'll get neglected because they don't fit neatly into the system.
- Developers are stuck to one project even if they've completed a certain task for the current project at hand they just have to wait for the next cycle as they'll be needed in that
- Can be difficult to maintain team motivation if they're not seeing any progress.
