### Overview
I want to create a CSS framework and UI Component Library mainly for darker UI's. From my experience working in web development in industry, other UI component libraries are lacking in some functionality that we found ourselves adding to multiple projects. 

When in work we often had to set up a global css file which had an abundance of pre-defined classes for thing like making images fit the container they're in or positioning a background image. I want to automate some of these things. We also never used any bootstrap components besides the grid system but i think if you could self-control things like border radius on a button that might be helpful. 

Of course a CSS framework is never going to be perfect and have something for everyone but I want to cater it to what I saw needed from my time in industry.  

Over the course of my studies we were introduced to about 3 different frameworks: - Semantic UI, Bootstrap, Material UI. Once you understand one well (mine being Bootstrap) you can grasp the other ones pretty easily so you're not entering an over-saturated market because new ones keep spawning and choosing your framework is just a matter of preference.
