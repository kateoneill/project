##### Key Functionality
###### Grid
Any other frameworks have their own ***grid*** system which makes sense. *Mobile-first development* is such a huge area of any kind of app or web design. Popularised by Eric Schmidt in a Google conference. The reason it's mobile first is because of the amount of limitations you have on a smartphone screen, you start with the screen with the smallest area to play with and add more features and design as you work up to desktop. Mobile first design means you "focus on the core of your product and strip away the rest" [link](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/ui-design/what-is-mobile-first-design/)The average smartphone size is 6.3" found [here](https://omdia.tech.informa.com/OM022757/Display-Dynamics--January-2022-Average-smartphone-display-size-stays-at-63-inches-while-the-resolution-can-be-potentially-enhanced#:~:text=Since%202021%2C%20the%20average%20has,6.3%2Dinch%20level%20since%202Q21.) where as the average laptop screen size is between 13.3 and 15" [here](https://voltfixer.com/average-laptop-screen-size/#:~:text=The%20average%20laptop%20screen%20size%20in%20the%20market%20is%2013.3,increase%20up%20to%2017.3%20inches.). That's a staggering difference in screen size and you want a memorable experience on either size. That's where grids come in. With mobile phone web usage only increasing year-on-year.  The need for this mobile-first approach is only increasing.![Crawford Gallery homepage](images/phoneusage.png)

The grid systems we know with Bootstrap, Tailwind or Bulma as outlined previously allow you to more easily design and develop for various display sizes. Grid systems can hinders outside the box designs as you want to keep it rigid to certain column widths etc. but it's simply a different way of thinking about design, some might say a more mathematical approach to design with fixed number of columns (typically 12 as it allows you to deal with both even and odd numbers on top of the grid) and gutter width to think about. 

###### Stylised Components
The grid is intended to be the foundation everything is built on in this scenario. On top of that we need to add some components that have pre-styled elements. Of course, I want some level of customisability with the elements but also want an approach where if someone were to enter bare-minimum class names, something would appear, somewhere between the out of the box styles of Bootstrap and the customisability of tailwind. 

- **Buttons** : Every site has buttons on to redirect you to different internal pages or different sections of the same page, You want them to stand out on your page to make them easily identifiable.  For marketing purposes having internal linking on your site is essential to boost your SEO scoring which will have you preferential in being the top results. Googles crawl bot "arrives at the websiteâ€™s homepage, renders the page, and follows the first link" [link here](https://yoast.com/internal-linking-for-seo-why-and-how/) It's attempting to figure out relationships between pages and posts.

![HM homepage](images/hm.png) ![Crawford Gallery homepage](images/crawford.png)The things highlighted in red are the internal linking buttons that are both linked very near the top of the homepage. In the second case it is integrated into the hero section of the webpage. This shows the importance of proper button styles. <br>A huge part of web design is the idea of a Call To Action (CTA) section. As is expected from the name, these sections are asking you to do something - buy this, subscribe here,  call us now, download our booklet. "Call to Actions are simple and effective ways to generate conversions and ultimately boost sales"[link here](https://www.sba.gov/blog/what-call-action-why-do-you-need-one-your-website). All buttons are effectively CTA's. ![Spotify Sign up](images/spotify.png) You'll notice the prominence of the buttons, the stark contrast from the background with the green makes our eye drawn to it and makes it stand out more to potential customers thus prompting us to sign up or download the app.

- **Cards**: It's usually an image and a heading followed by a small description along with it but it's more than that too. They're a nice way to display data and information in an organised manner. Often being clickable themselves, you want nice hover effects over any element. There are so many ways to display cards, your entire site could be card based (Pinterest) or you can use them to list products or your CTA's.
