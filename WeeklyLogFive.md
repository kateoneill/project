### Sprint 1 
5th October - 26th October
In this sprint it was attempted to identify goals of the project, get a good grasp on the background of why this project is necessary and narrow in on the target audience for the framework.  This will setup nicely into establishing the key functionality of the system especially following extensive research into various other frameworks. Recognising strong-points and the weaknesses in existing systems is key to making this new framework optimal. The key deliverables and realisations from this sprint were that this framework will use SCSS/SASS, the key functionality was identified as well as grasping a better understanding of designing  for dark mode. 

### Methodology completion
This project will implement Kanban principles. Kanban is a more visual way to organise tasks. It communicates clearly priorities and where each task is along the pipeline, it's easy to identify where tasks are being held up.  It will work best for this project as there are less time constraints. On smaller projects, Kanban is ideal for implementation. Outlining tasks specifically and defining work-in-progress are key parts of Kanban. 

### NPM, Yarn or CDN
A package manager, like Yarn or NPM, is used to organise and control what extra services and software are installed in your folder or project, 
<br><br>
NPM is the standard for node dependencies. It allows users to download, organise and use existing libraries, frameworks or software for their node project. Any existing software as listed on the Node registry can be installed and located using NPM. The modules installed via NPM help aid in the development process, meaning developers are not starting from scratch with every project. When running npm you use npm install to load in dependencies and they will be added to a package,json which is intrinsic to your project, meaning you are available to immediately start using installed modules.
<br><br>
Yarn is a JavaScript package manager, yarn is built on top of the NPM registry meaning any packages that are used in NPM can be carried over to Yarn. Yarn was built to improve some of NPM's shortfalls. It quickens up offline package installation for example. Yarn heightened security checks while downloading packages, something that was a weak point for NPM.

As is demonstrated above, NPM remains more popular than Yarn, which justifies optimising the framework for NPM, however, Yarn is not significantly behind to warrant ruling it out entirely.
