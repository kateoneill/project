**Identify background to project, goals, objectives, target audience**<br>
	*Background*<br>
		- I worked in web development on a placement semester (May 21 - Dec 21) and then returned this summer just gone (May 22 - Sept 22) where we were using Bootstrap primarily for its grid system but also its auto-adjusted typography and a few other mismatched classes to centre things etc. we always ended up using mainly custom CSS because of the rigidness that came with using Bootstrap. I always had a hefty global file that read in the same classes into every project worked on, things to fit images to their div size, to include basic background image styles or to set  various hr widths etc. While we had a formula and test file that could just be grabbed and dragged over from old projects if even that step could have been eliminated it would lead the development process to be more efficient.  I always had to add the colour variables and if you grabbed these global styles off another project that had a variable $limegreen but this new project doesn't have that you have to go reassign it then make sure it's not clashing with any other variables that carried over. <br>
		- On a project for web app development we created a movie web app and I wanted mine to be dark mode, I like working in dark mode it's usually my default settings so I figured that in choosing default colour options as most frameworks will do why not choose ones that work in dark modes.<br>
	*Goals*<br>
		BROAD SCALE<br>
		- Make web development as efficient as possible
		- Create a component library that has some flexibility for the developer
	<br>*Objectives*<br>
	NARROW SCALE<br>
		- Create a series of dark theme colour options for web including body colours as well as complimentary colours for common CSS components (Typography, Buttons, Tables, Links, Navbars, Pagination)
		- I want to include slightly more customisable CSS pre-defined classes to allow developers choose for example their button border radius via a pre-defined class. (Adding btn-25 will use a border-radius of 25% for example)
		- I intend to create docs for other people to easily be able to see how to implement my component library.
		- I will create sample webpages to show the CSS components in practice. 
	<br>*Target audience*<br>
		- I want my library to be accessible for people who have prior experience with other frameworks and CSS as a whole as I want to get specific with my intentions. As I outlined above I wanted to add things like customisable border-radius to button or pre-defined customisable hr widths. And also setting img classes to fill divs that they're in, while i'd like to think it wouldn't be inaccessible to a beginner my main focus will be on people who have familiarity as I don't want to have to oversimplify the components. 
		- I'm not doing a basics beginner framework or component library as I want to have some level of CSS customisation that would be easier to understand for one who has had experience, things like width on a hr or letter-spacing on text will be more familiar to someone who has written custom CSS before. 


<br>**Identify your functional and non-functional requirements for your project**<br>
<br>*Functional Requirements*<br>
- Different dark mode colour themes for the body 
- Complementary colour options for common components used - Typography, buttons, pagination, navbar, div, list, table
- Classes for optimal customisation :
	- to set letter spacing
	- set hr width or height
	- set border radius on buttons or images
	- set a no styles list
	- set properties for images to make this fit div
	- set properties for background-images to make them not repeat
	- contain background-images 
	- alter background-image position via pre-defined css classes and rules
	- allow altering of padding on typefaces.

<br>*Non-functional Requirements*<br>
- NPM install option to make it usable in projects

<br>**Identify Similar Systems**<br>
There are tons of CSS Frameworks and UI Component Libraries available on the market. 

The most popular is probably Bootstrap which is known for it's 12-col grid system for optimal mobile responsiveness. I have experience using Semantic UI and Material UI, which also employ grid systems as well as offering an abundance of pre-styled CSS components. I have familiarity with using buttons, typography, accordions,  cards and form components amongst them. 

There are an abundance of other ones which I have no familiarity with using but are increasingly popular such as Foundation which gives developers increased control over every element making it a bit more complex. Bulma is another one I have never used but comes up in research frequently. Every article I clicked on had a list of a variety of different ones so that shows there's a large market and a lot of scope.
